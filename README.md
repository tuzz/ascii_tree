## Ascii Tree

Parses a usable tree from ASCII art.

Ascii Tree turns something humans understand into something computers
understand. It is an expressive and efficient way to define trees.

##Â Usage

```ruby
root = AsciiTree.parse("

    # Here's a Christmas themed tree:

              chestnuts
              /    \   \
          roasting  on  an
           /   \         \
         open  fire      jack
               /   \
            frost  nipping
                    / \   \
                  on  your nose   # Ouch!

")

root.id
#=> "chestnuts"

root.parent
#=> nil

root.children
#=> [#<AsciiTree::Node @id="roasting">, ...]
```

## Multiple words

Use parenthesis to group words into a single node:

```ruby
root = AsciiTree.parse("

          (this is a single node)
              /   \   \     \   \
    (so is this)  but these are separate

")

root.id
#=> "this is a single node"
```

## Values

You can set arbitrary values on nodes:

```ruby
root = AsciiTree.parse("

        root{123}
         /    \
     a{"foo"}  b
       / \
      c   d{ [1, 2, 3].reverse }

")

root.value
#=> 123
```
